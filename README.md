# Stability-analysis-of-Lotka-Volterra-model: Qualitative Analysis of a Nonlinear Differential Equation.

Qualitative analysis of the predator-prey model using numerical and qualitative methods. The goal is to find equilibrium points and linearize the system around them to perform stability analysis, demonstrating that the solutions are periodic.
